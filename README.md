# Lanorian_Roguelite
A roguelite RPG that makes use of the Lanorian magic system of manipulating the environment. The basic idea is that you transfer 
certain Properties such as hardness, temperature, or luminosity to different parts of the environment.

More information to come.

UPDATE 09/02/2018: After some brainstorming, I decided to make this game into a _roguelite_ (real-time) instead of a roguelike (turn-based). 
UPDATE 09/04/2018: Decided to use LWJGL3 (OpenGL for Java)
